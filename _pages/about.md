<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I’m currently a master’s student in Computer and Information Science and Engineering at the University of Florida. During my graduate study at the University of Florida, I worked on a variety of security projects involving cellular network security, systems security, and software security. These projects have resulted in 3 published papers in cybersecurity, 2 of which are at the top 4 security conferences (<a href="https://sp2023.ieee-security.org/">IEEE S&P or Oakland</a> and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23">USENIX Security</a>). In addition to the published works discussed in my <a href="https://pnaghavi.github.io/cv/">CV</a>, I am currently working on a near submission work on cellular baseband security leveraging various static and dynamic analysis techniques. I also worked on a project involving the core cellular network security, and a project involving electromagnetic emanation signal analysis using novel wave transformer models.
<br />
My journey towards higher education in computer science started with my bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering (mechatronics option) at the University of British Columbia. I continued this journey towards formal computer science education by obtaining my master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, during which my education focused on electrical engineering and machine learning. At this time, I also worked on a number of academic projects in ML, RL, and DL. I also published a paper in NLP, which I recently presented at a top 2 ML conference (<a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022">NeurIPS</a>).
<br />
To further enhance my research aptitude, I am currently an intern at the University of Washington’s <a href="https://www.healthdata.org/">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)</a>, working as a researcher on a variety of projects currently under review or to be submitted at the top medical journals (<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/">Lancet</a>). These projects include global burden of disease of bullying, gun violence, and investigation of causes of death and hospitalization through the lens of patient medical records and history of doctor’s visits. During the internship, I obtained the CITI Human Subjects Learners Certification, allowing me to learn a great deal about human subject research procedures and analysis for cybersecurity and health informatics research.
<br />
My multifaceted education in various engineering disciplines and computer science, in addition to my research experience in machine learning, cybersecurity, and health informatics has provided me with an interesting breadth of knowledge as well as a unique perspective and ability to develop novel solutions to complex problems. That being said, I am very eager to develop a depth of knowledge in one specific area of computer science during my Ph.D. research and education as I am currently applying to computer science Ph.D. programs and searching for advisors whose research aligns with my past experiences.
